## Note
> Almost everything relies on the .scripts folder, I made sure to do my best to make it usable by anyone though.

> The lyrics background requires a vercel host of [lyrcisapi](https://github.com/raitonoberu/lyricsapi) which uses a spotify cookie to access musixmatch database for synced lyrics.

> Make sure the eww alias in .bashrc is correct for you!

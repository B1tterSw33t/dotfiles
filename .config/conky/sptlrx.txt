It feels like every time I talk to you I'm breakin' your heart
It's so bizarre, it's so crazy
I never thought that anyone would ever date me
Oh, oh, woah (oh, oh, woah)
She said stop (stop, stop)
Stop toolin' with my head
Promised me you'd never leave, that's what you had said
Now I'm all alone, you got me cryin' in our bed (fuck)
Most of all I miss my parents, I miss my friends
I hate the way I'm feelin' and it's only gettin' worse
I got you screamin' out "stop", while I scream it fucking hurts
Words can do some damage, didn't know that they would scar
Still I love you more than anything, I hate when we're apart
Yeah, she cries a lot, and honestly it's pretty hard
It feels like every time we talk we end up further apart, and
I don't know where to start
It feels like every time I talk to you I'm breakin' your heart
It's so bizarre, it's so crazy
I never thought that anyone would ever date me
Oh, oh, woah (oh, oh, woah)
No, I don't wanna yell but baby girl you're all I have
I need you hearin' what I say and if you need I'll run it back
I know that life can feel dull when you're lonely as fuck
It's like you're trippin' over everything, you're stuck in the mud
It's so absurd, huh, the way I'm writin' in the verse
I got some flow you never heard before, there's pain in every word
And I ain't never been the type to be like nothing ever works
But if I am, it's 'cause I lost you, that's some shit that I deserve

I heard a mutter then her phone died
And I've been waiting up the whole night
'Cause I don't know what she feels like
I show emotion, I get declined
Wish her a, rewind
I said I love her at the wrong time
And now I'm up until the sunrise
Sun's coming up, I'm coming down
From what I thought was love
I leave this town
I'm turned around from what I thought this was
My eyes are red, I'm still in bed
I blink, they're staying shut
I'm broken too
I don't think I'll find another one
"Need a minute", is what you said before you left
And now it's intermission
Can't even guess what's in your head
I made a quick decision
I should've left your text on read
Instead I never listen
'Cause now I'm left to wishing
That I was someone different, I was a wrong one
If someone else was pitching, it'd be a home run
And now I'm sitting wishing, praying it's true
Your phone is really glitching
It isn't you
I said I loved her over Facetime
I heard a mutter then her phone died
And I've been waiting up the whole night
'Cause I don't know what she feels like
I show emotion, I get declined
Wish her a, rewind
I said I love her at the wrong time
And now I'm up until the sunrise
And I'm so done
Been a real long night and a real long day
I'm so numb, I don't feel alright but I'll be okay, yeah
Sun's coming down
I'm giving up, I think I've had enough
I'm losing you but the truth is that I never won
Long flights is why we went together
Long nights I thought about forever
Alright, I should've waited up for real life
I thought long flights is why we went together
Long nights I thought about forever
Realise, should've waited up for real life
I said I loved her over Facetime
I heard a mutter then her phone died
And I've been waiting up the whole night
'Cause I don't know what she feels like
I show emotion, I get declined
Wish her a, rewind
I said I love her at the wrong time
And now I'm up until the sunrise
They said they need me but they don't believe me
The fans turning greedy 'bout what I do
Reading and weeping, I'm stuck to the ceiling
I write out my feelings, what I've been through
They said they see me, I vanish, Houdini
Yeah, I'm falling freely in solitude
I pick up the pace and I wipe off my face
I'm all over the place at this altitude
They said they need me but they don't believe me
The fans turning greedy 'bout what I do
Reading and weeping, I'm stuck to the ceiling
I write out my feelings, what I've been through
They said they see me, I vanish, Houdini
Yeah, I'm falling freely in solitude
I pick up the pace and I wipe off my face
I'm all over the place at this altitude
I can't see when you cover my eyes
Oh, what a pleasant surprise
You let the light back inside
And I can't breathe when I'm too scared to try
So I'll just stare at the sky until the sun starts to rise
And I fear that everything that I've done
Up until this point is nothing, yeah, I'm zero to one
I've been tripping over cables that my mind has unspun
But then I plug myself back in before the night doesn't come
Yeah, the acid ate the casing off my battery pack
Left my body on low power mode with panic attacks
Found an outlet in the wall but hit the floor for a nap
I don't think I can get up, yeah, I'ma call it a wrap
Now my visions getting blurry but my eyes are intact
All my memories erased and every movement is tracked
I don't think I am a human, just a vessel of tracks
So if you listen to this song, please put the volume to max
So I can hear it, I've become a spirit
I'm talking to you through this microphone
I think I've died, now I'm hollow inside
And I'm lost in a world where I'm all alone
Depression hittin' it's getting worst and I can't seem to listen
To the voice inside my head that tell me I can make a difference
'Cause I'm stuck inside the one that tell me I should not be livin'
Well, it's hard to see the beauty when I'm caught in tunnel vision
'Cause I'm stuck inside the one that tell me I should not be livin'
Well, it's hard to see the beauty when I'm caught in tunnel vision
Do I like to feel this way? It's like I'm searching for the pain
'Cause I know if I wanted change, that it would have to start today
But I'm lazy and I'd rather waste my time inside my bed
I'm contemplating over words that just wish I nevеr said
And all the texts that I would send that I wish you nеver read
'Cause I'd be lying if I told you that I wish I wasn't dead
All I got's a little hope that one day I won't be alone
And that the pain will fade and go, but how am I supposed to know?
Because there's nothing in a life that is a promise
I really hope if I would grab the rope, that somebody would stop it
Heads in the clouds, sun in my eyes
I'm done looking back, it's a waste of my time
I wanna feel home, everything is alright
I'll be feeling this soul for the rest of my life
I wanna go back to when I was young
Finding shame for the things that I've done
Heart on my sleeve, hittin' the woods
Got to hold on, it could always be worse
I left a message on your phone, I really hope that you reply
I know for you it's not important, but for me it's do or die
I wonder why I'm in this place
Why you tell me to my face that I'm the cause
Of all your problems and I'm taking up your space?
Or how the air that you breathe is not created for me?
I've got some problems, now you watchin' while I ruin everything
I've got a question, how I never seem to learn my lesson
How I never grasp the point, only grab the Smith and Wesson yeah
I keep a thousand yard stare and it's apparent
That my family name perished, I'm a fucking embarrassment
When a single good day is an event, it's like a miracle
I'm getting off on cymbalta, now I'm starting on the seroquel
But honestly, I need a little space to breathe
A way to clear my mind and learn to live with my deficiencies
A shame I turn to substances to cope I know it's rough to see
A life devoid of purpose filled with pain is not enough for me
Head in the clouds, sun in my eyes
I'm done looking back, it's a waste of my time
I wanna feel home, everything is alright
I'll be feeling this soul for the rest of my life
I wanna go back to when I was young
Finding shame for the things that I've done
Heart on my sleeve, hittin' the woods
Got to hold on, it could always be worse, yeah
I'll be stuck with my mistakes, I wear my heart up on my sleeve
So everybody could just see where I've been cut and left to bleed
All the scars and open wounds that I've been trying hard to heal
Like all the memories of us that
I just wish someone would steal
My insecurities are bound to get the best of me
But maybe when I will be dead then I will finally rest in peace
Cause lately I can't seem to ever find a way to fall asleep
The nightmare's running through my head but I don't think I ever dream
Afraid of who I was and knowing that he's never far behind
Creep into my mind and tell me I will never be alright
There's no way I could find anyone to ever fill me up inside
I'm broke, I'm losing hope, and you don't see my life for living lives
Smiles on my face and all the words that
I would say to make them finally go away
I even said I'm doing great, I know you know it isn't true
You see what I've been going through It isn't
Ever shocking news when I would play this song for you
Head in the clouds, sun in my eyes
I'm done looking back, it's a waste of my time
I wanna feel home, everything is alright
I'll be feeling this soul for the rest of my life
I wanna go back to when I was young
Finding shame for the things that I've done
Heart on my sleeve, hittin' the woods
Got to hold on, it could always be worse, yeah


You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus?
I'ma tell my mom not to pick me up today
If that's all right with...
Lately life at home, it's not been something I enjoy
I sit there staring at a wall while mama's breaking all my toys
I haven't seen my dad in weeks, wonder if he's still upstairs
I kinda wanna run away, I wonder if they'll ever care
She drives me straight to school, and doesn't ever say goodbye
It's probably 'cause of all the medicines she tastes so she won't cry
Alone at lunch, I need a friend, I'm sick of isolation
Lotta yelling in my head, but I'll still have this conversation with you
You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus?
I'ma tell my mom not to pick me up today
If that's all right with...
My teachers think that I'm okay, but no I never feel alright
The glass is breaking on the tile, parents do this every night
I'm smart enough to stop a fight
Not enough to pass my classes
Everybody laughin' at me, you're the one with no reaction
So comfortable with you, that I forget my life at home
I hope my mom doesn't get mad when she decides to check her phone
Told her I'm not coming home today
I'd rather take the bus, with someone who won't ever hurt me
I hope that this is worth it
You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus?
I'ma tell my mom not to pick me up today

One moment you were there and now you're gone
Every moment that we shared played like a song
I don't understand where we went wrong
I was tired of your shit but I still played along
Maybe I don't wanna kick rocks
I'm not really good with the sweet talk
Make my heart stop like the beat drop
Bullet, they fly like a sea hawk
She make me feel in moment
I don't wanna love you
Though I know it's tempting
Sick to my stomach like I haven't eaten
Don't ask me the reason I'm empty (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, you got me getting higher
It was you that I desired
You got me fucked up, you're a liar

They say talk about your problems
Okay, where do I begin?
Lately I've been chilling
And sipping on a few Heinekens
Wishing I could kill myself
Revive and then just die again
I'm looking at the stars
And thinking I wish I could fly with them
Grab a swisher, tuck and roll
Huff it in my lungs and nose
Keep on puffing up the smoke
And watch as all my problems blow
To the winners
They get scattered like the ashes
To the winners
They get scattered like the ashes
I've been tripping over bitches
Like I'm tripping off some acid
I gotta keep it passive
Hit the blunt and then I pass it
Wishing I could grip the pen
And slay my problems like a dragon
Demons been demanding
This depression got me manic
Keep puffing the herbs
Until I'm lost just like Atlantis
I don't really sleep much
Cause my nights are filled with panic
Lay me down inside the grave
I can no longer stand this
Life is like a card game
And I hate what I've been dealt
So fuck all my emotions
I'ma place them all on a shelf
♪
I know I need to quit these drugs
And I will eventually
And when I do I just hope
You don't hold this shit against me
Even when I'm feeling fine
I know this shit could tempt me
I just learned to turn to you
When I was feeling empty
And every time I do it
I feel suicidal
I never thought I had a problem
Till they killed my idols
I'm just trying to stay sober
But it's been awhile
And you can see my dirty habits
And a yellow smile
I ain't ever go out
Cause I ain't in the mood
I just roll another blunt
And try to hide up in my room
I'm just trapped in this cocoon
Penning my incoming doom
And I always feel depressed
So I'll just sing another tune
Woah
I pack my bags, I'm saying Adios
I'm never seeking help
Cause I ain't ready for that diagnose
Woah
Eyes closed slowed
That's comatose
And it runs in my family
So I guess it's time to overdose

Girl
Being by your side through everything's been hurting
And the scars you left on me, love they're no burden
I never wanna lose you from my heart
Are you still in my heart?
Wait
Where did you go
When you said it was over?
Did that mean that you'd forget about the time
When we found our shooting star?
And I looked into your eyes
And you looked back at mine
I'm lost in this world, I hate it
You're gone, but you're still my favorite
I hate when I let these feelings out
I wish you would want me
I wish you would love me
I wish you would
Wait
Where did you go
When you said it was over?
Did that mean that you'd forget about the time
When we found our shooting star?
And I looked into your eyes
And you looked back at mine
Oh, you save me
Oh, you save me
Oh, you save me
It's like oh you save me

Moonlit café
Jazz in the background
Clock strikes 12 as my partner gets sat down
Mad town, ain't it?
Heard him say between the sirens
But we both knew the answer, so there's no point in replying now
Someone made a call about an hour ago
About a body found, left out on Countington Road
No signs of struggle, no trauma sticking out or exposed
Just a heart shaped locket with two flowers enclosed
A single rose in a gold tinted tunic
With an old scented tulip wrapped around its fragile stem
And behind the flora's aura was engraved a battle hymn
It read "Better find me before I do it again"
No cause of death was ever found, nor identity recovered
It resembled a cadaver that was placed to be discovered
And it only took two weeks until we found another
But this time it was the figure of our home state's governor
Wait, wait, wait, wait, no...
Heart racing
The same circumstances, location, and pacing?
The same twisted flowers, same fingerprint erasing?
And the same heart shape with the same gold casing?
The same engraving, but now a new message
"This was your last chance to learn your lesson."
A threat in of itself, but upon further inspection
The carvings housed tainted blood samples and resin
Close examination led to find the same poison
In the body of the first victim that had been reported
Details recorded, mulled over, and considered
Were thought to be going nowhere
Until we received a picture
Of our victims at a party, hot and heavy, sharing hands
The governor was thought to be a faithful, married man
So when his wife was named the culprit and was rottin' in the can
I knew that I had been successful when I'd thought to lay my plan

I... I guess my question is do you...
Do you think it's too late for me?
What?
I mean a- a- a- am I just doomed to be the person that I am?
The... the person in that book
I- it's not too late for me. is it? it's not too late
Diane, I need you to tell me it's not too late
Bojack...
I... I... I... I need you to tell me i'm a good person
I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and self-destructive
But underneath all that deep down, I'm a good person
And I need you to tell me that I'm good
Tell me... please Diane
Tell me that I'm good
(Can you hear my voice through the storm)

Yeah, don't talk 'bout it
Don't talk 'bout it, uh, uh
Don't talk 'bout it
Don't talk 'bout it
Don't talk 'bout it, yeah, yeah
Don't talk
Papi
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everyone seems to be out to get me
Feeling like everyone's the same
But then I guess that makes me crazy
Screaming RIP Nicole
And RIP them all
And RIP my angel
Wish that she was coming home
Talking about how there would be plenty of grapes on the grapevine
I feel devastated and agitated at the same time
No ceilings, I aim high
No feelings, they ain't mine
No minutes, there ain't time
Danger, no sign
Tell me, how am I supposed to live if you ain't living, bae?
How am I supposed to change if not forgiven, bae?
Know you watching me from above, I hate for you to see
The heartaches, someone put me out my misery
When younger, told me love was in the air
Lately I just never care
All the walls are caving in
And I hate myself again
And I thought my plan would work
Got my feet up in the dirt
But I'm questioning my worth
And I need you now
Better hold on, baby you're strong, you're a soldier, yeah
They say that things change, all around you getting older, yeah
And until like we work, stay by my side, ring your hotline
I know how hard it all can be

It must be nice to have so much attention
Without my music, bet I wouldn't get a mention
Not a peep or a sound, not a pen drop around
Like I'm livin' in a silent dimension
It must be nice to have some friends in person
Goin' over to someone's house would be worth it
Do what's best for my life, and I'll do best for yours
But not everyone agrees with my certains
It must be nice to have parents that love you
When you come home from school, they always hug you
Yes, there's sticks and there's stones and they're breaking my bones
But every now and then, I need a hug too
It must be nice to have such a good friend group
Drama happens, but you have them to notice you
You can laugh, you can cry, you can ask, you can pry
But unfortunately, I don't get those to do
It must be nice to link with your online friends
I know with them, that the fun could never end
Yes there's hate, yes there's arguments
But you'll get over it
Well, not always, it depends
It must be nice to have something to live for
If I had that, then I'd probably live more
I don't care if it's small, if it's right, if it's wrong
I just want something to live and strive for
It must be nice to have someone who loves you
Who would kiss, who would fuck, who would hug you
Who would jump, who would laugh, all the human contact
All the texts saying "Good night, I love you"
It must be nice to have such a good fanbase
Releasing music at consistent, but slow rates
You don't even do much, you just rub, you just touch
But you're treated like a God in your own state
It must be nice to have stable connections
Something that won't effect your affections
Talking life, talking school, talking music and cool shit
But sometimes it comes with deceptions
It must be nice to not be used so often
I'm just dug up, and used like a coffin
When they're done, then they fade
Is it karma? It may be
But it makes it worse when I stop them
It must be nice to have friends who make music
Friends who take pride for it, don't abuse it
Everyone, they just sing just to hear themselves sing
But for me, this shit is therapeutic
It must be nice to not be left out all the time
Trapped in transparent boxes just like a mime
You can talk, you can yell, but they def will not tell
If you're speaking to them in their own minds

I'm never gon' let you down again
Fucked you good as I imagine
Said nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gonna let you...
Ghost for a whole week
Thought I really want your love but you don't know me
Text you all damn night, hour unholy
I couldn't get a second of sleep
When I found out you were just my type
I was dead wrong but it felt so right
When you caught my gaze with those dark green eyes
And I'm never gon' change thinking 'bout that twice
It's all chord changes and vocal lines
I'm a mess and it looks like you got your shit together
But despite all of my first impressions
I can't imagine what's gonna happen
I'm never gon' let you down again (get your ass back here)
Fucked you good as I imagine
Said nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you down again
Fucked you good as I imagine

I swore that I was fed up
How could I turn it back?
You got tied by the words I choked on
And the qualities I lack (he didn't answer me)
What is it I run from?
Deny it was best
The rest is left up to the somethings that exist outside my head
Now we've got a wedding for a whole week
Hold each other, remember the things you told me
Now there's only minutes until this plane leaves
But wait, did I just leave heaven or is it waiting there?
I'm never gon' let you down again
I'll fuck you good as I imagine
Said nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you down again
Can't get you out of my head
Said nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you...
If all is lost, I've got the peace in my mind
You'll probably be fine
I was scared of what you'd say
But since I've made some more mistakes (I'm never gon' let you...)
I've done some wrong things in the past, but that's okay
"Every Day's A Day"
Every day's a day, plenty of 'em wasted
And every night's a nightmare when you're not here
We're destined to decay but that don't mean I'm hopeless
So lost and in the rain, can't wait for you to notice me
If you want me to stay
I will stay right here for you
And maybe I'll be the one
To put the fun in funeral
Maybe I'll be the one
Instead of trying to run
Maybe I'll be the one
Maybe I'm the one, oh baby
Your love's like a loaded gun with no safety
So compassion and explosive
So aim for my heart
'Cause every day's a day, think I heard 'em say
I dare you to be real 'cause everybody ain't
And baby I won't love you, no I'm not a saint
Tell me I'ma love it before you run away, here in flames
And we could share a dream
Of a new beginning
So tell me will you meet there?
'Cause every day's a day, plenty of 'em wasted

I know that it feels like sometimes you don't know the real me
You're a lucky soul, you got the patience just to deal with me
I'm falling
I know sometimes I'm inconsistent, but I just can't help it
I can't explain how bad it's been
The cards that I've been dealt with
I've had cold times, not all the time
There's something that's been killing me
Falling apart, it's tearing me unwillingly
Wait no, I'm cool
Don't worry about me
I think that I'll be fine as long as I'm just following the rules
I live inside my head
That's not a great thing, but it's keeping me alive
So yeah, I'm cool
Don't worry about me

Warm up my dick, pinch her
Call her my dear, Prancer
When she call my phone, no answer

Spread the positivity like cancer
Tryna kill my spirits, they can't, sir
Dress retro like a lancer (ayy, ayy)
Like Spongebob, here's my answer
Hey Mister (hey Mister)
I might give a Glock to my sister (to my sister)
'Cause it's a dirty world, you could get hurt (you could get hurt)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister (kiss my keister)
Hey Mister (Mister)

Hey, Mister
Wake up, Henry
Y'all rocking with DJ Scheme, lil' bitch
My hair's on fire
(I've been burnt to the scalp)
But my body's so cold
(I can't sleep anymore)
This depression's getting old
(I'm sick of taking all these pills)
Throw away the cigarettes I rolled for you
(I miss you)
And when the daylight don't shine on me
You wouldn't wonder how I got this way
I wish that I could tell you how it felt to love
But my hearts too shattered and I'm pickin' up the pieces
I tried, I, I, tried
I tried, I won't lie
I tried, I, I, tried
I tried, I won't lie
I'm sick of my medication
My hair's on fire
(I've been burnt to the scalp)
But my body's so cold
(I can't sleep anymore)
This depression's getting old
(I'm sick of taking all these pills)
Throw away the cigarettes I rolled for you
(I miss you)
And when the daylight don't shine on me
You wouldn't wonder how I got this way
I wish that I could tell you how it felt to love
But my hearts too shattered and I'm pickin' up the pieces

I'm with pposture, I'm with p4rkr, I ain't talking 'bout no Peter
I don't like the confrontation
I'm a fan of conversations

Look at me, my drink, she laced it
Racks in my wallet, can't fold
Yeah, I'm off the horse then I start to lose control
Yeah, he talkin' shit so we wipin' his nose

Genocide on my mind, no survivors left
Nascar Aloe, bitch, I do got tire tread
I'm the devil, ho, I'm the one inside ya head
In my pit, a fight is a requirement
And I'd kill myself but I ain't dying yet
Guess while she's in my room finna die

Stop (What)
Where did we go wrong? Like
It hasn't even been long
I always searched for you
But hell, I don't have a clue
I might have made you a song, but
Does that even have a cost? No
Well baby it's all that I've got
Hoping that we could just stop

I left you, so I'll take the guilt
Please don't move and just sit still
Please don't go, it's me I'll kill
I trusted you, I guess right now you're dead to me
I look at you and every time I grit my teeth
She said we're friends but nah you're not friends with me
And I swear you would never get along with me
Look, you were the only friend I've ever had
But I still have all these cuts along my back
Thought I'd never forgive you
Never thought you'd be an issue
And I put every bit of my trust in her
Now I have a hard time trusting anyone
Forget you, I wanna be alone
I hate you, thought you were my bro

Gave her one call, now this bitch start crying (GothBoiClique)
Shorty wanna die but I know that bitch is lying
Flexed up, dying
With my clique, I'm crying
Hollywood lying, Hollywood lying
I just wanna flex on my wrist, start a riot (riot)
Lies on the ring, baby, yeah
I just wanna ride 'til my car's on fire (fire)
Really sorry, I think you should retire
Lie me down in bed, got my side bitch crying
Facetime Horse Head, tell him that I'm dying
Even though I'm lying, I might not be lying
Even though I'm lying, I might not be lying

It must be nice to have some friends in person
Goin' over to someone's house would be worth it
Do what's best for my life, and I'll do best for yours
But not everyone agrees with my certains
It must be nice to have parents that love you
When you come home from school, they always hug you
Yes, there's sticks and there's stones and they're breaking my bones
But every now and then, I need a hug too
It must be nice to have such a good friend group
Drama happens, but you have them to notice you
You can laugh, you can cry, you can ask, you can pry
But unfortunately, I don't get those to do
It must be nice to link with your online friends
I know with them, that the fun could never end
Yes there's hate, yes there's arguments
But you'll get over it
Well, not always, it depends
It must be nice to have something to live for
If I had that, then I'd probably live more
I don't care if it's small, if it's right, if it's wrong
I just want something to live and strive for
It must be nice to have someone who loves you
Who would kiss, who would fuck, who would hug you
Who would jump, who would laugh, all the human contact
All the texts saying "Good night, I love you"
It must be nice to have such a good fanbase
Releasing music at consistent, but slow rates
You don't even do much, you just rub, you just touch
But you're treated like a God in your own state
It must be nice to have stable connections
Something that won't effect your affections
Talking life, talking school, talking music and cool shit
But sometimes it comes with deceptions
It must be nice to not be used so often
I'm just dug up, and used like a coffin
When they're done, then they fade
Is it karma? It may be
But it makes it worse when I stop them
It must be nice to have friends who make music
Friends who take pride for it, don't abuse it
Everyone, they just sing just to hear themselves sing
But for me, this shit is therapeutic
It must be nice to not be left out all the time
Trapped in transparent boxes just like a mime
You can talk, you can yell, but they def will not tell
If you're speaking to them in their own minds

I do not want to be in the fucking [?] this shit any longer
I am God, what the fuck are you?
American wasteland, no face, no case, make them sprint like a race
American wasteland, no rules in this place, fuck the law and the state
American wasteland, no face, no case, make them sprint like a race
American wasteland, no rules in this place, fuck the law and the state
I been debating 'bout whether not you just act hard
Y'all pussies hating but do not know what the facts are
You fucks is suckin' my dick then shoot up that black tar
The throne is vacant, but wait, what about NASCAR? (Haha)
I see you talkin' but you lacking that confidence
I'm bout to hock and spit on this bitch 'cause she offerin'
Ain't got no competence, 'bout to cut off your oxygen
He in the pit, he get hit and losing his consciousness
I don't fucking like people, thought I told you this
Then you hop up in the pit, you get a swollen lip
So tell me if I'm fuckin' up
To me your love is worth more than gold
When heaven becomes too much
I'll find a way to break the mold
European coins in my pocket
Chains around my heart
Girl I locked it up
European coins in my pockets
Foreign to your love
I don't doubt it now
Holdin' on your hand out in Poland
And my Prada from Milan (from Italy)
I watched the sunrise in Barcelona
But still I'd rather be looking at you
European coins in my pocket
Chains around my heart
Girl I locked it up
European coins in my pockets
Foreign to your love
I don't doubt it now
European coins in my pocket
Chains around my heart
Girl I locked it up
European coins in my pockets
Foreign to your love
I don't doubt it now
And it is all for you
Four gold chains
Gave two to my brothers
Last one for my lover

It's like you treat me in such a way
I vanish everyday
I wanna hide my face
You don't listen to me
But I find that okay
You will listen someday
Today's just not the day
Oh, so I'm crazy now? That's what you told me
I'm not the crazy one, at least not mostly
You just throw words around, don't listen closely
Say I'm the worst around, I'm dyin' slowly
And they wanna make my life hell
So I might give 'em hell
These people wish me death
I smile and wish them well
Wanna make my life hell
So I might give 'em hell

I'm not your plaything, I'm feelin' hopeless
For me, I'm lyin' on the street
Waitin' for sudden end
Want you to come to me
So we can make amends
You don't have to pretend
That we were never friends
It's just the time we spend
I think I'm losin' it, sick to my stomach
I like to suffer 'cause I deserve it
And it's so hard to just mind my business
I see everything, I overheard it
It's like you treat me in such a way

You don't wanna fuck with me and my crew
Watch me observe all the shit that I do
Lil youngin' who are you

Is it just me, or is everyone pretending?
They drag you through the mud, and act a pal and act a friend
And it hurts, 'cause I can't really comprehend
And it gets worse, so I don't really recommend it
But can you go like five minutes without making it worse?
I can't accept that you like it and this has to have hurt
It's just so fake and artificial, I don't want it anymore
I fucking hate it here, just let me go
(Pierre, no)
(Huh?)
It's upside down, I'm on the ceiling, sick of screaming
I'm upside down, it's so confusing but it's not
It's upside down, I'm on the ceiling, sick of scrеaming
I'm upside down, it's so confusing how I'm feeling
I had the wrong friends, always calling mе a prick
Come home from school, said "I'll never be shit"
I can't escape, so I lock myself away, inside all-day
Do everything before you wake
But can you go like five minutes without making it worse?
I can't accept that you like it and this has to have hurt
It's just so fake and artificial, I don't want it anymore

Blue screen, black view
Blue eyes: white
New feed: tattooed
My mind: high
Cooties castles
We stay inside
Who needs bad moods
I got mine
Spinning through some crystal
Keep it clear, we stay abyssal
Diamonds dancing through my vision
My new mission: to go pick em up
Double up my focus hocus pocus
Spitting magic, manic motions
With my mixing cos i'm schizin'
On some killer mud
Purple drank
Got my body sank into the couch
Speakers loud, let the lyrics
That i write leave yo mouth
Aye
Whatchu think
I don't get a thing from the clout
Hit the cloud
Up my tempo, tempered metal
Tempting blades out

Want bath salt, don't pass on
A chance to be the last one
Awake with the mask on
Love it when we kick it
Hit the safe, get the cash, gone
Don't need less, I sniff it
I'm a saint
But we in corrupted times
Let's get fucked up and waste away

She said her boyfriend's bi and he tryna fuck
I don't gotta contrive it
Is it 'cause I break down when it's piling up?
Feet crushed by a mallet
Hit a brand new speed, add it to my palette, no talent, uh
My nails need a new polish
I'll show these motherfuckers how to find sauce in the rough
I found it stuck in my crib
You hit me online sayin' fuck promises
I wouldn't pass that up, said I never did
Now I haven't seen the sun in months
I can't afford to give a fuck
As soon as I get out, we'll get it in
So, I better fuck off with the small talk
You can save the mileage
I poured sauce then it popped off
And I made it out here
I'm all up in your mentions and I know you 'bout this

The Real
Bitch you oppin', floggin', posted on my watch list
Say that you invincible, okay nigga, watch this
One phone call, and his brains we'll get to moppin'
Sorry I'm so hyped up, I'm just dumb obsessed with violence
Anxiety, I'm runnin' out of options
Cut 'em out my life, just like a photo, I just crop 'em
If they start to bother me, I cut 'em off or stop them
Why am I so ignorant? Why am I so toxic?
I don't want that many friends in the first place
Most people I wouldn't depend on the worst day
Circle small because I do not like drama
Got a problem? Then go cry to your momma
Anti-social, anti-fun 'cause I'm a reject
Life's a bitch and I'm a prick, I need to re-check

Like, oh
What do you want from me?
I cannot see in front of me
I'll kill myself for Halloween
All for you
Walkin' down the street
I see a bunch of kids dressed up like me
And it make me feel alone when I see everyone coming together again
Pick up your friends if you have some now
Speak up to me 'cause I have none
So happy Halloween from me to you
I'm fallin' on my knees and screamin' at you
Rotten children
I fell in love but not the feeling type for you
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Yeah, I can't find my head
Maybe I'm undead
Follow everyone around 'cause they won't be my friеnd
And I can't find the time today
You can learn to run away
I'll kill mysеlf for Halloween
All for you
Too tired to call my friends
Wish I was young again
Carving pumpkins while the streets lit up
But I'm older now
We don't dress up, we don't talk much
I'm just fucked up
We're just fucked up, can't you see?
Wish I had a different perspective
Wish I had a better one
Guess I'll join the spirits in the night time
Guess I won't be knocking at your door
What do you want from me?
I cannot see in front of me
I'll kill myself for Halloween
All for you

The cutlery won't cut through all this flesh 'cause it's too rubbery
This ain't no robbery (It's not), he won't make recovery
Heard you four deep, kick you first and then the other three
This is a crime scene, poison with VISINE
Germs, GI on repeat while you dying
Horns on my head, not no motherfuckin' Viking
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Let's, let's get
Let's change it up a bit

Bitch, I'll decide if you live or die
Human flesh is, to me, like a piece of pie
I hate people, I swear that I feel like
I'm Albert Wesker in Resident Evil 5
And them guns in your video CGI
So I'll meet you on Friday, no TGI
I keep [?]
I get vengeance, our tension is attractin'
Which one of you pissin' me off? I'ma match 'em
My bitch shaved like apples, I cut out his Adam
If I catch you snitchin' separate your atoms
I drop on yo' flat and get your tires flattened
You walk out the crib and pausin' like, "What happened?"
And that is exactly when it fuckin' happened
Now he knocked in the back of the wagon
Fucked up, on the way to my cabin, you bitch

I wish I couldn't be like that
Why I gotta be like that?
How do I not be like that?
I don't wanna fucking be here
'Cause all I do is nothing
Make some music, and lay in bed
And disappoint my friends
I don't feel like I should be here
'Cause fuck, I'm never noticed
I'm blowing up, and that's pretty cool
But I still feel I'm fucking lonely
I feel like I'm just a problem
A burden on their chest
A chip on the shoulder, a nail in the tire
The elephant in the room
Ain't been feeling good so often
I don't know what's the problem
Sorry I can't satisfy you anyway
Look what you made me
I hope that you're happy
I hope that you're staring
I hope that you're laughing
No, I am not happy

Turned into someone people come on to

Dumb boy with a numb girl, tryna get rich
Lovesick, but my outfit cost a ticket
Toxic, first saw her in a mosh pit
Lost it, all my friends saying I lost it
Dumb boy with a numb girl, tryna get rich
Lovesick, and I'm fuckin' dumb bitch
But you the one I love bitch
I might get stabbed in the back, hey
When I die, I will come back, hey
Ask me why I dress in black, hey
It just represents my soul
In the coldness of this world
Die in a spin or a twirl
Die in a spin or a twirl
Die because of a rumor
Die because of a rumor
Drama is fucking absurd
Flipping a bird
I just forgive and forget, ha
Cuss out a bitch like I got some tourettes
Sneak outside and I light a cigarette
Sheesh, I am so stressed out
I might cut my fucking neck now
People wanna obsess now
All because I got some damn clou-
It is such a cruel world
I wanna paint a picture and destroy it
To show my accomplishments whirled
I stand inside a closet
I just scream at a mic
That's not what I call talent
I get so damn detached from reality
I do not notice my own absence
Sometimes I run out into the middle
Of the street full of ongoing traffic
Looking to see who will stop, who will drive
Just to show that this type of shit happens
Willing to martyr myself for no reason
'Cause I wanna go out for something
'Cause I'ma be damned if I'm committing murder
And then I just go out for nothing
For nothing

Ayy
This Mexican bitch
Wubz, you killed this shit
I might get stabbed in the back, hey
When I die, I will come back, hey
Ask me why I dress in black, hey

Yo
I'm pushing you away
'Cause every time we talk, it hurts
Help me cure out my depression
It gave me a sense of worth
It's like you helped me out the mud
And then shoved me in the dirt
Now I'm stuck feeling like I'm the only person on the Earth
You were like my world
And I watched it fall apart
Now I'm drifting through the cosmos
And circling the stars
Help me put the blade down
And close up all the scars
But now my biggest scar
Is the one up on my heart
If it took my life to be with you
Then I would gladly give it
Depression's an infection
And you're the cure for the sickness
Lately, I been trippin', and honestly I don't get it
It was only three months, but it felt like a minute
I'm stupid and annoying
But that's only 'cause I care
And any time you need me, girl you know that I'll be there
Most nights, I'm staring down a barrel
It's too much to bear
I'm afraid to let you go
I'll admit I'm fucking scared
And I hate being sober 'cause then I can feel the pain
So I tell myself to numb it and then grab the fucking blade
Watching as the droplets roll down my wrist like its rain
And I don't wanna leave
But you know that I can't stay

You don't know the pain that I feel
Wasting time on love that wasn't real
See me alone, I'm just skin and bones now
Oh, I think I'm turning into ash
You call my phone, but I'm never home now
You couldn't save me from myself
Lies they left me with a broken heart
Wounds leave scars when they're always torn apart
So write me a eulogy
All you can do for me
This is the story of my life
So let me lay here
There's nothing to save here
'Cause I'm already dead

It isn't me I don't want to feel
Wake me up and tell me it's a dream
I could never be anything that you wanted from me
It isn't me I don't want to feel

Drowning in my sorrows but there's nothing here to show
All people really fake
Lying to my face
Telling me they there but never meaning what they say
Call me up now ask some questions
Help me out I need lessons
All these games why I'm stressing
Too much work life's depressing
Only wanna check up when you hear it in my lyrics
Say you okay but I'm not okay
Asking do you need some help really acting like they mean it

Hard times
Wish I could go make time
Never had enough went back I had a save mine
Wishing you would pick up
Wishing you would call back
Talk me through problems
Say you caring hope you mean that
Maybe I'm too sad maybe I'm not
Maybe y'all just flexing like y'all not
Maybe I'm just honest should I stop
Start telling lies like I'm not
Sad and lonely no cure
All these sins a monster
Fix me up still not pure

I could search but I'd never find better, yeah (find better)
You always talk with a gentle voice
You draw me in like an open door
You're the girl that's been in my dreams
You're the ghost I've been searching for
When you leave I still think about you (think about you)
And when you're close all my dreams come true (dreams come true)
And when you leave I still think about you (yeah, I still think about you)
And when you're near all my dreams come true (dreams come true)
I think about you
Depression hittin' it's getting worst and I can't seem to listen
To the voice inside my head that tell me I can make a difference
'Cause I'm stuck inside the one that tell me I should not be livin'
Well, it's hard to see the beauty when I'm caught in tunnel vision
Do I like to feel this way? It's like I'm searching for the pain
'Cause I know if I wanted change, that it would have to start today
But I'm lazy and I'd rather waste my time inside my bed
I'm contemplating over words that just wish I nevеr said
And all the texts that I would send that I wish you nеver read
'Cause I'd be lying if I told you that I wish I wasn't dead
All I got's a little hope that one day I won't be alone
And that the pain will fade and go, but how am I supposed to know?
Because there's nothing in a life that is a promise
I really hope if I would grab the rope, that somebody would stop it
Heads in the clouds, sun in my eyes
I'm done looking back, it's a waste of my time
I wanna feel home, everything is alright
I'll be feeling this soul for the rest of my life
I wanna go back to when I was young
Finding shame for the things that I've done
Heart on my sleeve, hittin' the woods
Got to hold on, it could always be worse
I left a message on your phone, I really hope that you reply
I know for you it's not important, but for me it's do or die
I wonder why I'm in this place
Why you tell me to my face that I'm the cause
Of all your problems and I'm taking up your space?
Or how the air that you breathe is not created for me?
I've got some problems, now you watchin' while I ruin everything
I've got a question, how I never seem to learn my lesson
How I never grasp the point, only grab the Smith and Wesson yeah
I keep a thousand yard stare and it's apparent
That my family name perished, I'm a fucking embarrassment
When a single good day is an event, it's like a miracle
I'm getting off on cymbalta, now I'm starting on the seroquel
But honestly, I need a little space to breathe
A way to clear my mind and learn to live with my deficiencies
A shame I turn to substances to cope I know it's rough to see
A life devoid of purpose filled with pain is not enough for me
Head in the clouds, sun in my eyes
I'm done looking back, it's a waste of my time
I wanna feel home, everything is alright
I'll be feeling this soul for the rest of my life
I wanna go back to when I was young
Finding shame for the things that I've done
Heart on my sleeve, hittin' the woods
Got to hold on, it could always be worse, yeah
I'll be stuck with my mistakes, I wear my heart up on my sleeve
So everybody could just see where I've been cut and left to bleed
All the scars and open wounds that I've been trying hard to heal
Like all the memories of us that
I just wish someone would steal
My insecurities are bound to get the best of me
But maybe when I will be dead then I will finally rest in peace
Cause lately I can't seem to ever find a way to fall asleep
The nightmare's running through my head but I don't think I ever dream
Afraid of who I was and knowing that he's never far behind
Creep into my mind and tell me I will never be alright
There's no way I could find anyone to ever fill me up inside
I'm broke, I'm losing hope, and you don't see my life for living lives
Smiles on my face and all the words that
I would say to make them finally go away
I even said I'm doing great, I know you know it isn't true
You see what I've been going through It isn't
Ever shocking news when I would play this song for you
Head in the clouds, sun in my eyes
I'm done looking back, it's a waste of my time
I wanna feel home, everything is alright
I'll be feeling this soul for the rest of my life
I wanna go back to when I was young
Finding shame for the things that I've done
Heart on my sleeve, hittin' the woods
Got to hold on, it could always be worse, yeah

Maybe I can be so sad when I'm not
Life can be so lonely and I'm stuck up in these thoughts
Everything I'm wanting I can have it at the top
But I'm at the bottom I'm surrounded by thesw rocks
If I had love would I still feel this lonely?
I was by myself and nobody had to show me
Never gave a fuck, nobody tried to know me
Handing out these guns but nobody tryna blow me
I don't wanna be here, I just wanna go
Wanna leave my family, everybody that I know
Suicidal thoughts, will they miss me when I go?
Tryna get high, I been riding all the lows
Finally getting sober and it bringing back the pain
Sunny for a minute now it's cloudy with the rain
Shit falling down and it bringing back mistakes
Future looking blurry I don't see it in my fate (in my fate, in my fate)
Why, oh why?
I don't wanna be here I just wanna die
Always been sad, and I'll never be alright
Why, oh why?
I don't wanna be here I just wanna die
Always been sad, and I'll never be alright
Please come and save me, I really need saving
These are not just lyrics, I'm really not playing
This life that I'm living, I feel like I'm faking
If I can't be real then it's time for the taking
Come take my life and my soul
When I'm not even old
I been searching for a heart 'cause my heart is so cold
Say I don't listen, not doing I'm told
Don't fit the system I'll never be gold
If I hit escape would I just fall and go to hell?
Moses say I would but who is he to go and tell?
Wanna judge me now but not gon' hear me when I yell
I been crying out, steady asking for some help
Nobody wanna talk, nobody picking up the vibes
Smile on my face but they can tell that it's a lie
Cover for the sorrow that I'm feeling deep inside
Hit 'em with the shock when they hear I wanna die
Why, oh why?
I don't wanna be here I just wanna die
Always been sad, and I'll never be alright
Why, oh why?
I don't wanna be here I just wanna die
Always been sad, and I'll never be alright

Serotonin filled my mind
Show me places I can't find
You wake me up, you make me sick
But without you, I can't live, can't win
I do my best to push you far as I can reach
There's a part of me you took, and I can't find it in a drink
There's a part of me that's gone, that I won't ever redefine
I'm no longer who I was, I guess that's part of spending time
There's a part of me that's gone, that I won't ever redefine
I'm no longer who I was, I guess that's part of spending time
Oh, I wonder if the substance that I use to feel okay
Will eventually put me in a hollow wooden grave
Who knew music was the answer? Maybe art was on a list
Of the things I had to do to realize that I can live
Serotonin filled my mind
Show me places, I can't find
You wake me up, you make me sick
But without you, I can't live

Can't hide it, but I'm helpless, sometimes I just can't help it
I ruin friendships left and right, oh me, oh my, I'm selfish

Even if I pulled up, treat me like a fool, I
I'm so done with the games, I might pull up a charade
Would you love me the same if I asked you to stay?
I got smoke in my lungs, it goes straight to my veins
Would you love me the same if I took all the blame?
I have panic attacks, and I don't ever relax
I don't know how to act when you be turning your back
I don't know how to act when you be turning your back
And lately, I don't ever act right, remember that night?
You lost control, you couldn't keep up with the fast life
I have panic attacks, and I don't ever relax
I don't know how to act when you be turning your back
And lately, I don't ever act right, remember that night?
You lost control, you couldn't keep up with the fast life

Yeah, she cries a lot, and honestly it's pretty hard
It feels like every time we talk we end up further apart, and
I don't know where to start
It feels like every time I talk to you I'm breakin' your heart
It's so bizarre, it's so crazy
I never thought that anyone would ever date me
Oh, oh, woah (oh, oh, woah)
She said stop (stop, stop)
Stop toolin' with my head
Promised me you'd never leave, that's what you had said
Now I'm all alone, you got me cryin' in our bed (fuck)
Most of all I miss my parents, I miss my friends
I hate the way I'm feelin' and it's only gettin' worse
I got you screamin' out "stop", while I scream it fucking hurts
Words can do some damage, didn't know that they would scar
Still I love you more than anything, I hate when we're apart
Yeah, she cries a lot, and honestly it's pretty hard
It feels like every time we talk we end up further apart, and
I don't know where to start
It feels like every time I talk to you I'm breakin' your heart
It's so bizarre, it's so crazy
I never thought that anyone would ever date me
Oh, oh, woah (oh, oh, woah)
No, I don't wanna yell but baby girl you're all I have
I need you hearin' what I say and if you need I'll run it back
I know that life can feel dull when you're lonely as fuck
It's like you're trippin' over everything, you're stuck in the mud
It's so absurd, huh, the way I'm writin' in the verse
I got some flow you never heard before, there's pain in every word
And I ain't never been the type to be like nothing ever works
But if I am, it's 'cause I lost you, that's some shit that I deserve

My heart's so cold, I can't feel girl, yeah
I don't even know what's the real world, ay
I just wanna know what's up with you, ay
If you wanna talk girl I miss you, yeah
I've been so numb since you left me, yeah
How am I supposed to move on if you text me, ay
All I can think about is you on me, yeah
You got me questioning if you want me, ay
You only answer me in the moonlight, yeah
That's when you tell me that you are all mine
But in the morning you always leave yeah
I always fall for it, I can't believe it, ay
You only answer me in the moonlight, yeah
That's when you tеll me that you are all mine
But in thе morning you always leave yeah
I always fall for it, I can't believe it
Yeah, yeah
And my hearts so cold, feel it freezing
Yeah, yeah
I just wanted you to know you're the reason
Yeah, yeah
Turn my heart to stone, I'm so faded
(I'm so faded, I'm so faded)
Yeah, yeah
Now my only way to smile is getting wasted
(Getting wasted, yeah)
My heart's so cold, I can't feel girl, yeah
I don't even know what's the real world, ay
I just wanna know what's up with you, ay
If you wanna talk girl I miss you, yeah
I've been so numb since you left me, yeah
How am I supposed to move on if you text me, ay
All I can think about is you on me, yeah
You got me questioning if you want me, ay
You only answer me in the moonlight, yeah
That's when you tell me that you are all mine
But in the morning you always leave yeah
I always fall for it, I can't believe it, ay
You only answer me in the moonlight, yeah
That's when you tell me that you are all mine
But in the morning you always leave yeah
I always fall for it, I can't believe it


I can feel your heartbeat when you fall asleep
There is something nice about
Knowing all of you is next to me
And I don't think that there is
A single place I'd rather be
Honestly, I need you here with me
I need somebody
Don't wanna fuck me
Just wanna love me right
I need someone to
Need me to come through
Love me and hold me tight
I need to see it
I need a way to believe it
My feeling will change with the season
Make me feel guilty for breathing
And I can't write a single song
I'm scared of how it makes her feel
She hears my song, she thinks I'm wrong
She's scared that I won't ever heal
I try my best to show you how
I love you more and more each day
But understand I'm just a man
I'm vulnerable to all the pain
I love you
More than I can put in words
How come no one out there ever
Told me love would ever hurt?
I love you
More than I can put in words
How come no one out there ever
Told me love would ever hurt?
I can feel your heartbeat when you fall asleep
There is something nice about
Knowing all of you is next to me
And I don't think that there is
A single place I'd rather be
Honestly, I need you here with me

I see, dead eyes on the verge of suicide
I realize it's not alright
I'll find my way to idolize it
In my eyes, I'll reach the sky (yeah, ayy)
Runnin' outta breath, I been runnin' outta energy
Tellin' all your friends you don't wanna be a friend to me
You makin' up lies, why am I gettin' all the penalties?
I wanna talk about us without talking to an enemy
I've been broken down like my food in my stomach
Hatin' these feelings, but act like I love it
I don't wanna cheat, nah, I want fair play
I don't wanna crash land like an airplane
I want you back but when you act like that
Like a one-sided talk, you don't call me back
Yeah, times were hard and when you left, they got harder
My bed got colder and my room got darker
I'm still in love, I know, so are you
Why'd I pray for the rain when our skies were blue
I'm still in love, I know, so are you
Let's talk tonight and we can talk it through
I see, dead eyes on the verge of suicide
I realize it's not alright
I'll find my way to idolize it
In my eyes, I'll reach the sky
Tell me if I'm lost, and all the days it took
I gave it all I had, without a second look
And I need breathing room, if I don't see you soon
I think I'll die inside, I'll blame it all on you
I think I'm gone for good, it happened faster than it should
And now it's upside down, I must've misunderstood
But I still wish you were here, and maybe one day you will
And while I wait for you, I'll pop another pill
Black long sleeve, I can see you're freezing
You know I'll stop your bleeding
Let's not make this hard, let's just hit restart
Messed up badly, how'd this all happen
This world's a mess so please don't leave us stranded
I'm swimming in the ocean of fear
Back where I started, no closer each year
I think, maybe you'll start to disappear
As I cope with these emotions, I don't wanna get closer
I see, dead eyes on the verge of suicide
I realize it's not alright
I'll find my way to idolize it
In my eyes, I'll reach the sky
Dead eyes on the verge of suicide
I realize it's not alright
I'll find my way to idolize it
In my eyes, I'll reach the sky

I know when I write this you won't like it, yeah I'm sad
Wishing you would smile when your heart's under attack
Yeah I'm breathing really heavy' baby please don't turn your back
I be talking out our problems when you miss your mom and dad
You miss them bad too' tell me when I ask you
Love your authenticity' you're pretty but you're sad too
You know I always love you even if I don't have too
Baby, you're my everything I'm sorry for my bad mood
Baby girl, I trust you more than I can put in words
I'd be happy to help you if you would tell me when it hurts
You be crying every night it's not depression it's a curse
You're the girl that I've been
Fighting for but you think you're the worst
It's like every time I look into your eyes I swear
Nothing in the world could ever compare (no)
When I fell for you I dove
Finally I'm happy' honestly I lost hope
Do you feel your heart sink when you think of my face
Does it help you fall asleep or does it keep you awake
Do you see me in your dreams, do I haunt you in your sleep
Do you wish that I was someone else you wanted me to be
I can't take it all the pressure on my back
Wishin' I was different we both blame it on my past
I can't even act right, I don't ever sleep
Wishin' I was everything you wanted me to be
No' I can't take this I've been breaking, you stay on my mind
Half the time I write about you I don't wanna try
It's like every time I look into your eyes I swear
Nothing in the world could ever compare (no)
When I fell for you I dove
Finally I'm happy, honestly I lost hope
I can't even take it all I ever do is stress out
Feeling like I'm light it's like I never put the pen down
Murder every line every time I'm a threat bro
Killing ever track like I got a fucking death note

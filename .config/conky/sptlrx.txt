It feels like every time I talk to you I'm breakin' your heart
It's so bizarre, it's so crazy
I never thought that anyone would ever date me
Oh, oh, woah (oh, oh, woah)
She said stop (stop, stop)
Stop toolin' with my head
Promised me you'd never leave, that's what you had said
Now I'm all alone, you got me cryin' in our bed (fuck)
Most of all I miss my parents, I miss my friends
I hate the way I'm feelin' and it's only gettin' worse
I got you screamin' out "stop", while I scream it fucking hurts
Words can do some damage, didn't know that they would scar
Still I love you more than anything, I hate when we're apart
Yeah, she cries a lot, and honestly it's pretty hard
It feels like every time we talk we end up further apart, and
I don't know where to start
It feels like every time I talk to you I'm breakin' your heart
It's so bizarre, it's so crazy
I never thought that anyone would ever date me
Oh, oh, woah (oh, oh, woah)
No, I don't wanna yell but baby girl you're all I have
I need you hearin' what I say and if you need I'll run it back
I know that life can feel dull when you're lonely as fuck
It's like you're trippin' over everything, you're stuck in the mud
It's so absurd, huh, the way I'm writin' in the verse
I got some flow you never heard before, there's pain in every word
And I ain't never been the type to be like nothing ever works
But if I am, it's 'cause I lost you, that's some shit that I deserve

I heard a mutter then her phone died
And I've been waiting up the whole night
'Cause I don't know what she feels like
I show emotion, I get declined
Wish her a, rewind
I said I love her at the wrong time
And now I'm up until the sunrise
Sun's coming up, I'm coming down
From what I thought was love
I leave this town
I'm turned around from what I thought this was
My eyes are red, I'm still in bed
I blink, they're staying shut
I'm broken too
I don't think I'll find another one
"Need a minute", is what you said before you left
And now it's intermission
Can't even guess what's in your head
I made a quick decision
I should've left your text on read
Instead I never listen
'Cause now I'm left to wishing
That I was someone different, I was a wrong one
If someone else was pitching, it'd be a home run
And now I'm sitting wishing, praying it's true
Your phone is really glitching
It isn't you
I said I loved her over Facetime
I heard a mutter then her phone died
And I've been waiting up the whole night
'Cause I don't know what she feels like
I show emotion, I get declined
Wish her a, rewind
I said I love her at the wrong time
And now I'm up until the sunrise
And I'm so done
Been a real long night and a real long day
I'm so numb, I don't feel alright but I'll be okay, yeah
Sun's coming down
I'm giving up, I think I've had enough
I'm losing you but the truth is that I never won
Long flights is why we went together
Long nights I thought about forever
Alright, I should've waited up for real life
I thought long flights is why we went together
Long nights I thought about forever
Realise, should've waited up for real life
I said I loved her over Facetime
I heard a mutter then her phone died
And I've been waiting up the whole night
'Cause I don't know what she feels like
I show emotion, I get declined
Wish her a, rewind
I said I love her at the wrong time
And now I'm up until the sunrise
They said they need me but they don't believe me
The fans turning greedy 'bout what I do
Reading and weeping, I'm stuck to the ceiling
I write out my feelings, what I've been through
They said they see me, I vanish, Houdini
Yeah, I'm falling freely in solitude
I pick up the pace and I wipe off my face
I'm all over the place at this altitude
They said they need me but they don't believe me
The fans turning greedy 'bout what I do
Reading and weeping, I'm stuck to the ceiling
I write out my feelings, what I've been through
They said they see me, I vanish, Houdini
Yeah, I'm falling freely in solitude
I pick up the pace and I wipe off my face
I'm all over the place at this altitude
I can't see when you cover my eyes
Oh, what a pleasant surprise
You let the light back inside
And I can't breathe when I'm too scared to try
So I'll just stare at the sky until the sun starts to rise
And I fear that everything that I've done
Up until this point is nothing, yeah, I'm zero to one
I've been tripping over cables that my mind has unspun
But then I plug myself back in before the night doesn't come
Yeah, the acid ate the casing off my battery pack
Left my body on low power mode with panic attacks
Found an outlet in the wall but hit the floor for a nap
I don't think I can get up, yeah, I'ma call it a wrap
Now my visions getting blurry but my eyes are intact
All my memories erased and every movement is tracked
I don't think I am a human, just a vessel of tracks
So if you listen to this song, please put the volume to max
So I can hear it, I've become a spirit
I'm talking to you through this microphone
I think I've died, now I'm hollow inside
And I'm lost in a world where I'm all alone
Depression hittin' it's getting worst and I can't seem to listen
To the voice inside my head that tell me I can make a difference
'Cause I'm stuck inside the one that tell me I should not be livin'
Well, it's hard to see the beauty when I'm caught in tunnel vision
'Cause I'm stuck inside the one that tell me I should not be livin'
Well, it's hard to see the beauty when I'm caught in tunnel vision
Do I like to feel this way? It's like I'm searching for the pain
'Cause I know if I wanted change, that it would have to start today
But I'm lazy and I'd rather waste my time inside my bed
I'm contemplating over words that just wish I nevеr said
And all the texts that I would send that I wish you nеver read
'Cause I'd be lying if I told you that I wish I wasn't dead
All I got's a little hope that one day I won't be alone
And that the pain will fade and go, but how am I supposed to know?
Because there's nothing in a life that is a promise
I really hope if I would grab the rope, that somebody would stop it
Heads in the clouds, sun in my eyes
I'm done looking back, it's a waste of my time
I wanna feel home, everything is alright
I'll be feeling this soul for the rest of my life
I wanna go back to when I was young
Finding shame for the things that I've done
Heart on my sleeve, hittin' the woods
Got to hold on, it could always be worse
I left a message on your phone, I really hope that you reply
I know for you it's not important, but for me it's do or die
I wonder why I'm in this place
Why you tell me to my face that I'm the cause
Of all your problems and I'm taking up your space?
Or how the air that you breathe is not created for me?
I've got some problems, now you watchin' while I ruin everything
I've got a question, how I never seem to learn my lesson
How I never grasp the point, only grab the Smith and Wesson yeah
I keep a thousand yard stare and it's apparent
That my family name perished, I'm a fucking embarrassment
When a single good day is an event, it's like a miracle
I'm getting off on cymbalta, now I'm starting on the seroquel
But honestly, I need a little space to breathe
A way to clear my mind and learn to live with my deficiencies
A shame I turn to substances to cope I know it's rough to see
A life devoid of purpose filled with pain is not enough for me
Head in the clouds, sun in my eyes
I'm done looking back, it's a waste of my time
I wanna feel home, everything is alright
I'll be feeling this soul for the rest of my life
I wanna go back to when I was young
Finding shame for the things that I've done
Heart on my sleeve, hittin' the woods
Got to hold on, it could always be worse, yeah
I'll be stuck with my mistakes, I wear my heart up on my sleeve
So everybody could just see where I've been cut and left to bleed
All the scars and open wounds that I've been trying hard to heal
Like all the memories of us that
I just wish someone would steal
My insecurities are bound to get the best of me
But maybe when I will be dead then I will finally rest in peace
Cause lately I can't seem to ever find a way to fall asleep
The nightmare's running through my head but I don't think I ever dream
Afraid of who I was and knowing that he's never far behind
Creep into my mind and tell me I will never be alright
There's no way I could find anyone to ever fill me up inside
I'm broke, I'm losing hope, and you don't see my life for living lives
Smiles on my face and all the words that
I would say to make them finally go away
I even said I'm doing great, I know you know it isn't true
You see what I've been going through It isn't
Ever shocking news when I would play this song for you
Head in the clouds, sun in my eyes
I'm done looking back, it's a waste of my time
I wanna feel home, everything is alright
I'll be feeling this soul for the rest of my life
I wanna go back to when I was young
Finding shame for the things that I've done
Heart on my sleeve, hittin' the woods
Got to hold on, it could always be worse, yeah


You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus?
I'ma tell my mom not to pick me up today
If that's all right with...
Lately life at home, it's not been something I enjoy
I sit there staring at a wall while mama's breaking all my toys
I haven't seen my dad in weeks, wonder if he's still upstairs
I kinda wanna run away, I wonder if they'll ever care
She drives me straight to school, and doesn't ever say goodbye
It's probably 'cause of all the medicines she tastes so she won't cry
Alone at lunch, I need a friend, I'm sick of isolation
Lotta yelling in my head, but I'll still have this conversation with you
You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus?
I'ma tell my mom not to pick me up today
If that's all right with...
My teachers think that I'm okay, but no I never feel alright
The glass is breaking on the tile, parents do this every night
I'm smart enough to stop a fight
Not enough to pass my classes
Everybody laughin' at me, you're the one with no reaction
So comfortable with you, that I forget my life at home
I hope my mom doesn't get mad when she decides to check her phone
Told her I'm not coming home today
I'd rather take the bus, with someone who won't ever hurt me
I hope that this is worth it
You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus?
I'ma tell my mom not to pick me up today

One moment you were there and now you're gone
Every moment that we shared played like a song
I don't understand where we went wrong
I was tired of your shit but I still played along
Maybe I don't wanna kick rocks
I'm not really good with the sweet talk
Make my heart stop like the beat drop
Bullet, they fly like a sea hawk
She make me feel in moment
I don't wanna love you
Though I know it's tempting
Sick to my stomach like I haven't eaten
Don't ask me the reason I'm empty (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, you got me getting higher
It was you that I desired
You got me fucked up, you're a liar

They say talk about your problems
Okay, where do I begin?
Lately I've been chilling
And sipping on a few Heinekens
Wishing I could kill myself
Revive and then just die again
I'm looking at the stars
And thinking I wish I could fly with them
Grab a swisher, tuck and roll
Huff it in my lungs and nose
Keep on puffing up the smoke
And watch as all my problems blow
To the winners
They get scattered like the ashes
To the winners
They get scattered like the ashes
I've been tripping over bitches
Like I'm tripping off some acid
I gotta keep it passive
Hit the blunt and then I pass it
Wishing I could grip the pen
And slay my problems like a dragon
Demons been demanding
This depression got me manic
Keep puffing the herbs
Until I'm lost just like Atlantis
I don't really sleep much
Cause my nights are filled with panic
Lay me down inside the grave
I can no longer stand this
Life is like a card game
And I hate what I've been dealt
So fuck all my emotions
I'ma place them all on a shelf
♪
I know I need to quit these drugs
And I will eventually
And when I do I just hope
You don't hold this shit against me
Even when I'm feeling fine
I know this shit could tempt me
I just learned to turn to you
When I was feeling empty
And every time I do it
I feel suicidal
I never thought I had a problem
Till they killed my idols
I'm just trying to stay sober
But it's been awhile
And you can see my dirty habits
And a yellow smile
I ain't ever go out
Cause I ain't in the mood
I just roll another blunt
And try to hide up in my room
I'm just trapped in this cocoon
Penning my incoming doom
And I always feel depressed
So I'll just sing another tune
Woah
I pack my bags, I'm saying Adios
I'm never seeking help
Cause I ain't ready for that diagnose
Woah
Eyes closed slowed
That's comatose
And it runs in my family
So I guess it's time to overdose

Girl
Being by your side through everything's been hurting
And the scars you left on me, love they're no burden
I never wanna lose you from my heart
Are you still in my heart?
Wait
Where did you go
When you said it was over?
Did that mean that you'd forget about the time
When we found our shooting star?
And I looked into your eyes
And you looked back at mine
I'm lost in this world, I hate it
You're gone, but you're still my favorite
I hate when I let these feelings out
I wish you would want me
I wish you would love me
I wish you would
Wait
Where did you go
When you said it was over?
Did that mean that you'd forget about the time
When we found our shooting star?
And I looked into your eyes
And you looked back at mine
Oh, you save me
Oh, you save me
Oh, you save me
It's like oh you save me

Moonlit café
Jazz in the background
Clock strikes 12 as my partner gets sat down
Mad town, ain't it?
Heard him say between the sirens
But we both knew the answer, so there's no point in replying now
Someone made a call about an hour ago
About a body found, left out on Countington Road
No signs of struggle, no trauma sticking out or exposed
Just a heart shaped locket with two flowers enclosed
A single rose in a gold tinted tunic
With an old scented tulip wrapped around its fragile stem
And behind the flora's aura was engraved a battle hymn
It read "Better find me before I do it again"
No cause of death was ever found, nor identity recovered
It resembled a cadaver that was placed to be discovered
And it only took two weeks until we found another
But this time it was the figure of our home state's governor
Wait, wait, wait, wait, no...
Heart racing
The same circumstances, location, and pacing?
The same twisted flowers, same fingerprint erasing?
And the same heart shape with the same gold casing?
The same engraving, but now a new message
"This was your last chance to learn your lesson."
A threat in of itself, but upon further inspection
The carvings housed tainted blood samples and resin
Close examination led to find the same poison
In the body of the first victim that had been reported
Details recorded, mulled over, and considered
Were thought to be going nowhere
Until we received a picture
Of our victims at a party, hot and heavy, sharing hands
The governor was thought to be a faithful, married man
So when his wife was named the culprit and was rottin' in the can
I knew that I had been successful when I'd thought to lay my plan

I... I guess my question is do you...
Do you think it's too late for me?
What?
I mean a- a- a- am I just doomed to be the person that I am?
The... the person in that book
I- it's not too late for me. is it? it's not too late
Diane, I need you to tell me it's not too late
Bojack...
I... I... I... I need you to tell me i'm a good person
I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and self-destructive
But underneath all that deep down, I'm a good person
And I need you to tell me that I'm good
Tell me... please Diane
Tell me that I'm good
(Can you hear my voice through the storm)

Yeah, don't talk 'bout it
Don't talk 'bout it, uh, uh
Don't talk 'bout it
Don't talk 'bout it
Don't talk 'bout it, yeah, yeah
Don't talk
Papi
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everyone seems to be out to get me
Feeling like everyone's the same
But then I guess that makes me crazy
Screaming RIP Nicole
And RIP them all
And RIP my angel
Wish that she was coming home
Talking about how there would be plenty of grapes on the grapevine
I feel devastated and agitated at the same time
No ceilings, I aim high
No feelings, they ain't mine
No minutes, there ain't time
Danger, no sign
Tell me, how am I supposed to live if you ain't living, bae?
How am I supposed to change if not forgiven, bae?
Know you watching me from above, I hate for you to see
The heartaches, someone put me out my misery
When younger, told me love was in the air
Lately I just never care
All the walls are caving in
And I hate myself again
And I thought my plan would work
Got my feet up in the dirt
But I'm questioning my worth
And I need you now
Better hold on, baby you're strong, you're a soldier, yeah
They say that things change, all around you getting older, yeah
And until like we work, stay by my side, ring your hotline
I know how hard it all can be

It must be nice to have so much attention
Without my music, bet I wouldn't get a mention
Not a peep or a sound, not a pen drop around
Like I'm livin' in a silent dimension
It must be nice to have some friends in person
Goin' over to someone's house would be worth it
Do what's best for my life, and I'll do best for yours
But not everyone agrees with my certains
It must be nice to have parents that love you
When you come home from school, they always hug you
Yes, there's sticks and there's stones and they're breaking my bones
But every now and then, I need a hug too
It must be nice to have such a good friend group
Drama happens, but you have them to notice you
You can laugh, you can cry, you can ask, you can pry
But unfortunately, I don't get those to do
It must be nice to link with your online friends
I know with them, that the fun could never end
Yes there's hate, yes there's arguments
But you'll get over it
Well, not always, it depends
It must be nice to have something to live for
If I had that, then I'd probably live more
I don't care if it's small, if it's right, if it's wrong
I just want something to live and strive for
It must be nice to have someone who loves you
Who would kiss, who would fuck, who would hug you
Who would jump, who would laugh, all the human contact
All the texts saying "Good night, I love you"
It must be nice to have such a good fanbase
Releasing music at consistent, but slow rates
You don't even do much, you just rub, you just touch
But you're treated like a God in your own state
It must be nice to have stable connections
Something that won't effect your affections
Talking life, talking school, talking music and cool shit
But sometimes it comes with deceptions
It must be nice to not be used so often
I'm just dug up, and used like a coffin
When they're done, then they fade
Is it karma? It may be
But it makes it worse when I stop them
It must be nice to have friends who make music
Friends who take pride for it, don't abuse it
Everyone, they just sing just to hear themselves sing
But for me, this shit is therapeutic
It must be nice to not be left out all the time
Trapped in transparent boxes just like a mime
You can talk, you can yell, but they def will not tell
If you're speaking to them in their own minds

I'm never gon' let you down again
Fucked you good as I imagine
Said nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gonna let you...
Ghost for a whole week
Thought I really want your love but you don't know me
Text you all damn night, hour unholy
I couldn't get a second of sleep
When I found out you were just my type
I was dead wrong but it felt so right
When you caught my gaze with those dark green eyes
And I'm never gon' change thinking 'bout that twice
It's all chord changes and vocal lines
I'm a mess and it looks like you got your shit together
But despite all of my first impressions
I can't imagine what's gonna happen
I'm never gon' let you down again (get your ass back here)
Fucked you good as I imagine
Said nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you down again
Fucked you good as I imagine

I swore that I was fed up
How could I turn it back?
You got tied by the words I choked on
And the qualities I lack (he didn't answer me)
What is it I run from?
Deny it was best
The rest is left up to the somethings that exist outside my head
Now we've got a wedding for a whole week
Hold each other, remember the things you told me
Now there's only minutes until this plane leaves
But wait, did I just leave heaven or is it waiting there?
I'm never gon' let you down again
I'll fuck you good as I imagine
Said nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you down again
Can't get you out of my head
Said nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you...
If all is lost, I've got the peace in my mind
You'll probably be fine
I was scared of what you'd say
But since I've made some more mistakes (I'm never gon' let you...)
I've done some wrong things in the past, but that's okay
"Every Day's A Day"
Every day's a day, plenty of 'em wasted
And every night's a nightmare when you're not here
We're destined to decay but that don't mean I'm hopeless
So lost and in the rain, can't wait for you to notice me
If you want me to stay
I will stay right here for you
And maybe I'll be the one
To put the fun in funeral
Maybe I'll be the one
Instead of trying to run
Maybe I'll be the one
Maybe I'm the one, oh baby
Your love's like a loaded gun with no safety
So compassion and explosive
So aim for my heart
'Cause every day's a day, think I heard 'em say
I dare you to be real 'cause everybody ain't
And baby I won't love you, no I'm not a saint
Tell me I'ma love it before you run away, here in flames
And we could share a dream
Of a new beginning
So tell me will you meet there?
'Cause every day's a day, plenty of 'em wasted

I know that it feels like sometimes you don't know the real me
You're a lucky soul, you got the patience just to deal with me
I'm falling
I know sometimes I'm inconsistent, but I just can't help it
I can't explain how bad it's been
The cards that I've been dealt with
I've had cold times, not all the time
There's something that's been killing me
Falling apart, it's tearing me unwillingly
Wait no, I'm cool
Don't worry about me
I think that I'll be fine as long as I'm just following the rules
I live inside my head
That's not a great thing, but it's keeping me alive
So yeah, I'm cool
Don't worry about me

You'll get a fist serve, yuh
Balenciaga sock on me all green like the Grinch, sir, yuh
They might need a rinse sir, huh
When I attack her, my dick like a sword, I'ma fence her
Warm up my dick, pinch her
Call her my dear, Prancer
When she call my phone, no answer
I'ma dip on the bitch like red syrup
Spread the positivity like cancer
Tryna kill my spirits, they can't, sir
Dress retro like a lancer (ayy, ayy)
Like Spongebob, here's my answer
Hey Mister (hey Mister)
I might give a Glock to my sister (to my sister)
'Cause it's a dirty world, you could get hurt (you could get hurt)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister (kiss my keister)
Hey Mister (Mister)
Hey, Mister (Mister), I might give a Glock to my sister
It's a dirty world, you could get hurt
Told her enemies to kiss my keister
Mister
Hey, Mister
Wake up, Henry
Y'all rocking with DJ Scheme, lil' bitch
My hair's on fire
(I've been burnt to the scalp)
But my body's so cold
(I can't sleep anymore)
This depression's getting old
(I'm sick of taking all these pills)
Throw away the cigarettes I rolled for you
(I miss you)
And when the daylight don't shine on me
You wouldn't wonder how I got this way
I wish that I could tell you how it felt to love
But my hearts too shattered and I'm pickin' up the pieces
I tried, I, I, tried
I tried, I won't lie
I tried, I, I, tried
I tried, I won't lie
I'm sick of my medication
My hair's on fire
(I've been burnt to the scalp)
But my body's so cold
(I can't sleep anymore)
This depression's getting old
(I'm sick of taking all these pills)
Throw away the cigarettes I rolled for you
(I miss you)
And when the daylight don't shine on me
You wouldn't wonder how I got this way
I wish that I could tell you how it felt to love
But my hearts too shattered and I'm pickin' up the pieces
(Hi Dopa)

Ching that cunt

Had-had-had to use a bullet, bet he crying on the floor
Pop, pop this
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pack on me (Give me that)
I'm not even joking when I said that I don't need her
At least I got a fuckin' woman, got a Glock if you wan' meet up
I'm with kurtains, I'm with Wido, in the back, we got a heater
I'm with pposture, I'm with p4rkr, I ain't talking 'bout no Peter
I don't like the confrontation
I'm a fan of conversations
Talk your shit, bro, I ain't breaking
Look at me, my drink, she laced it
Racks in my wallet, can't fold
Yeah, I'm off the horse then I start to lose control
Yeah, he talkin' shit so we wipin' his nose
They got inside me, jumping out the fourth floor
'Bout to take my life, I'm going real low
Silver chain on me, so heavy, move slow
Three weapons on me, in my heart, oh no
Weapon on me, hit my heart, oh no
Ching that cunt
Got a spinner to his throat
Had-had-had to use a bullet, bet he crying on the floor

Pussy boy, talkin' shit? He will get chin checked (Yeah, aight)
Y'all just some drums, y'all a minor threat
He get burned up like engine or fighter jet (Oh, right?)
Genocide on my mind, no survivors left
Nascar Aloe, bitch, I do got tire tread
I'm the devil, ho, I'm the one inside ya head
In my pit, a fight is a requirement
And I'd kill myself but I ain't dying yet
Guess while she's in my room finna die
I hate people, yes, I'm evil
Pop goes the Glock, bitch, it's not a fuckin' weasel
Stroll through drugged up, double down with the theme color
Toilet, throw up with the piss and the fecal (Yeah)

Stop (What)
Where did we go wrong? Like
It hasn't even been long
I always searched for you
But hell, I don't have a clue
I might have made you a song, but
Does that even have a cost? No
Well baby it's all that I've got
Hoping that we could just stop

I left you, so I'll take the guilt
Please don't move and just sit still
Please don't go, it's me I'll kill
I trusted you, I guess right now you're dead to me
I look at you and every time I grit my teeth
She said we're friends but nah you're not friends with me
And I swear you would never get along with me
Look, you were the only friend I've ever had
But I still have all these cuts along my back
Thought I'd never forgive you
Never thought you'd be an issue
And I put every bit of my trust in her
Now I have a hard time trusting anyone
Forget you, I wanna be alone
I hate you, thought you were my bro

Gave her one call, now this bitch start crying (GothBoiClique)
Shorty wanna die but I know that bitch is lying
Flexed up, dying
With my clique, I'm crying
Hollywood lying, Hollywood lying
I just wanna flex on my wrist, start a riot (riot)
Lies on the ring, baby, yeah
I just wanna ride 'til my car's on fire (fire)
Really sorry, I think you should retire
Lie me down in bed, got my side bitch crying
Facetime Horse Head, tell him that I'm dying
Even though I'm lying, I might not be lying
Even though I'm lying, I might not be lying

It must be nice to have some friends in person
Goin' over to someone's house would be worth it
Do what's best for my life, and I'll do best for yours
But not everyone agrees with my certains
It must be nice to have parents that love you
When you come home from school, they always hug you
Yes, there's sticks and there's stones and they're breaking my bones
But every now and then, I need a hug too
It must be nice to have such a good friend group
Drama happens, but you have them to notice you
You can laugh, you can cry, you can ask, you can pry
But unfortunately, I don't get those to do
It must be nice to link with your online friends
I know with them, that the fun could never end
Yes there's hate, yes there's arguments
But you'll get over it
Well, not always, it depends
It must be nice to have something to live for
If I had that, then I'd probably live more
I don't care if it's small, if it's right, if it's wrong
I just want something to live and strive for
It must be nice to have someone who loves you
Who would kiss, who would fuck, who would hug you
Who would jump, who would laugh, all the human contact
All the texts saying "Good night, I love you"
It must be nice to have such a good fanbase
Releasing music at consistent, but slow rates
You don't even do much, you just rub, you just touch
But you're treated like a God in your own state
It must be nice to have stable connections
Something that won't effect your affections
Talking life, talking school, talking music and cool shit
But sometimes it comes with deceptions
It must be nice to not be used so often
I'm just dug up, and used like a coffin
When they're done, then they fade
Is it karma? It may be
But it makes it worse when I stop them
It must be nice to have friends who make music
Friends who take pride for it, don't abuse it
Everyone, they just sing just to hear themselves sing
But for me, this shit is therapeutic
It must be nice to not be left out all the time
Trapped in transparent boxes just like a mime
You can talk, you can yell, but they def will not tell
If you're speaking to them in their own minds

I do not want to be in the fucking [?] this shit any longer
I am God, what the fuck are you?
American wasteland, no face, no case, make them sprint like a race
American wasteland, no rules in this place, fuck the law and the state
American wasteland, no face, no case, make them sprint like a race
American wasteland, no rules in this place, fuck the law and the state
I been debating 'bout whether not you just act hard
Y'all pussies hating but do not know what the facts are
You fucks is suckin' my dick then shoot up that black tar
The throne is vacant, but wait, what about NASCAR? (Haha)
I see you talkin' but you lacking that confidence
I'm bout to hock and spit on this bitch 'cause she offerin'
Ain't got no competence, 'bout to cut off your oxygen
He in the pit, he get hit and losing his consciousness
I don't fucking like people, thought I told you this
Then you hop up in the pit, you get a swollen lip
So tell me if I'm fuckin' up
To me your love is worth more than gold
When heaven becomes too much
I'll find a way to break the mold
European coins in my pocket
Chains around my heart
Girl I locked it up
European coins in my pockets
Foreign to your love
I don't doubt it now
Holdin' on your hand out in Poland
And my Prada from Milan (from Italy)
I watched the sunrise in Barcelona
But still I'd rather be looking at you
European coins in my pocket
Chains around my heart
Girl I locked it up
European coins in my pockets
Foreign to your love
I don't doubt it now
European coins in my pocket
Chains around my heart
Girl I locked it up
European coins in my pockets
Foreign to your love
I don't doubt it now
And it is all for you
Four gold chains
Gave two to my brothers
Last one for my lover

And I keep a Spanish chica like "¡Olé!"
